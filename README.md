Still Patterns is a calm, contemplative web application designed to support reflection, pattern recognition, and clearer decision-making.

The project hosts time-tested symbolic practices in a quiet, focused digital environment. Rather than offering prediction or certainty, it encourages users to slow down, notice structure, and engage thoughtfully with their own questions.

This repository currently features an interactive I Ching (Book of Changes) experience built with modern web technologies and a deliberately restrained design philosophy.
